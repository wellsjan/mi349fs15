<div class = "column">My name is Jannelle Wells. I have a fraternal twin sister named Jazmine. She is one minute 
	older than I am. She attends the University of Michigan, so we techniclly have a 
	"House Divided". For the most part, I do enjoy being a twin, knowing that I will always have 
	someone to count on and someone who will be there for me no matter what.  </div>
